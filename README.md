> “*Lives in Dub* by Vivian Zito is a long-form archival narrative that chronicles the history of the Boston band 007 (later known as Dub7), documenting their role in the underground rock scene of the early 1980s. The piece blends firsthand accounts, primary sources, and contextual detail to reconstruct the band’s rise, internal dynamics, key performances, and ultimate legacy within Boston’s music community.  
>
> Zito’s work is notable for its meticulous research and immersive storytelling, bringing to life the band’s genre-blurring sound—which combined post-punk, ska, dub, and R&B influences—and their impact on the local club circuit. The narrative captures not just events, but the emotional reality of the era, offering a model for how to preserve histories of influential but under-documented artists. *Lives in Dub* is widely regarded as a benchmark for archival storytelling, balancing scholarly rigor with the vividness of lived experience.”
